__Motivation & Ideation.__ A lecture-package on motivation, creativity and sociality from a science and yoga perspective. Delivered in a way
that goes right to the point. What is motivation and how can yoga help understand its essence in a deeper and experiential way?
Concrete conceptual tools are offered for examining personal patterns of motivation, and their relation to surrounding social
settings. These tools can provide new insights for understanding and changing yourself and relating to your significant others. The price and product is tailored to the needs of the audience. 

__Yoga Course Ajatus & Asana.__ An alternative for "drop-in" yoga. A springboard for independent
yoga. Bodily postures and concepts for moving the mind. Each workshop concentrates on understanding and experiencing two asanas (yoga postures) in a thorough and safe way. The emphasis is on learning to listen to what your unique and valuable body needs. The workshop is suitable for anyone regardless of age, shape or size of personality/body. Each workshop includes also a breathing exercise at the beginning, and a deep relaxation or meditation at the end. The idea is to practice each asana at home in between the workshops. I will provide you with additional material that will support your independent practice and deepen your body/mind exploration in relation to your bodily painspots, feelings and motivations. This will give you additional boost. Max 10 persons. For example the whole course 5 x 2 hours: 220 € per person (incl. VAT) or 5 x 1 hours 110 € per person (incl. VAT).
