_Yoga and BodyMind Teaching and Coaching with Thought - Espoo Viherlaakso_

What a wonderful feeling it would be to get to know oneself even better. To relax and let go of wordly trouble in a cosy and peaceful setting. To become more conscious of the power invested in one's breath. To learn to read one's bodily messages in a productive way. To connect with one's feelings and bodily sensations. To learn lifelong tools and knowledge for managing stress and emotional anxiety. To let one's internal teacher guide towards a more creative and renewed authentic self. To be able to do this in an honest and confidential eviroment that apperiactes one's unique life history and experience.

Ajatus & Asana Ltd offers inspiring pedagogical bodymind coaching based on yoga as well as psychological, sociological and physiological knowledge. 

For more information see the weekly yogaclass schedule, individual coaching sessions & home yoga programms, and the 3-hour miniretreats. Yoga class in English every Thursday 6.30 -8.00 pm.

Curious? I will gladly tell you more!

A Warm Welcome,

Stephanie Freeman, PhD, M.A., Diploma Yoga Teacher

*Once you start listening, you realize how wise the body can be. It whispers, it shouts, it laughs, it hums, it purrs of contentment. It converses and invites you to a dialogue. When you are ready.*
