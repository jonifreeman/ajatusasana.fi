What is the natural rhythm of my life? Would it be possible to live my life in sync
and in unison with other peopleâ€™s rhythms? What about with the rhythms of the
ICT-based economy and working life? How could I get back in touch with
my creativity? How and when do I know that I am moving in the right
direction? How can I accomplish my true self, and at the same time be
a full-fledged member of society, work life, communities and family? 

I want to help you find the life instructor within you by giving you
tools for thought, and yoga asanas for exploring your sensing
body. Developing your internal compass can help you navigate the
social and material environment in a physically and mentally
beneficial way. The aim is an independent person, who feels good in
his/her body and in his/her immediate social surroundings.
