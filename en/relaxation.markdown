**CONVERSATIONAL YOGA RELAXATION**

Would you like to unwind in a relaxing atmosphere and be genuinely heard?  Are you searching for inspiration in some area of your (working) life?  Or perhaps you just need a little nudge to better trust your intuition in decision-making? 

Conversational Yoga Relaxation is for anyone who would like to gain deeper awareness to a pressing issue in their (social)life. You do not need prior experience in relaxing or yoga. I combine different relaxation and somatic awareness techniques and holistic yoga with a deep socio-psychological understanding of the richness of human life.


The length of the session: 90 min.


Prices:

1 session 90 €

2 sessions 160 €

3 sessions 220 €

All prices include communication outside the lesson. If you have any questions etc., just write an email or give me a call. Speaking out your mind is never a waste of time.

Curious?

I will gladly tell you more!
