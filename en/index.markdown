_Yoga and BodyMind Teaching and Coaching with Thought - Espoo Viherlaakso_


How wonderful it would feel to know oneself even better. To relax and let go of worldly affairs in a 
cosy and peaceful setting. To become more conscious of the power of breath. To learn to read one's 
bodily messages in a productive way. To connect with greater awareness with one's feelings and 
bodily sensations. To learn lifelong tools and knowledge for managing stress and emotional anxiety. 
To let the internal teacher within guide you towards a more creative and renewed authentic self. 
And to be able to do this in an environment that values your unique life history and experience.


Ajatus & Asana offers inspiring pedagogical BodyMind teaching and coaching based on yoga as well as psychological, 
sociological and physiological knowledge. 


For more information, see the weekly yoga class schedule, possibilities for individual coaching 
sessions & home yoga programmes, and the 3-hour mini retreats. A yoga class is given in English 
every Thursday from 6.30 to 8.00 pm.


Curious? I will gladly tell you more!

Once you start listening, you realize how wise the body can be. It whispers, it shouts, it 
laughs, it hums, it purrs with contentment. It converses and invites you to a dialogue.
