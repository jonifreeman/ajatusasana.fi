April, 2013.

My name is Stephanie Freeman. I am a researcher-yogi-hobbyist drummer. One foot in science, the
other one in wellbeing, the aim being to build a strong bridge 
between the two. My 41 year life trajectory could be summarized through the
following three partly overlapping phases: body first, head first, and
body/mind in unison.

I lived the first third of my life through and for my body, teaching
hip-hop-influenced aerobics and dance classes. Although I expressed
myself through my body, and wanted to make others feel good through
movement and music, I was not really listening to what my wise body was
trying to tell me. I made errors, overtaxed it’s capacity.

I started searching for answers in the academia. I was hungry for
theoretical knowledge, and wanted to understand the workings of the
human mind and contemporary society, to the extent that I defended my
PhD thesis on volunteer Internet community construction and
participants' motivation paths in 2011. I spent altogether 13 years in
the world of ideas and “in the head”, even though the theoretical
disciplines that I relate to–socio-cultural theory and cultural
psychology–consider the relation between mind, body and society
inseparable. Scientific work and ambition, accompanied with
competition, made my body and mind collapse a few times. I had created
myself a “stress body”. I also went through a stressful and
unsuccessful IVF treatment, which was hard on my highly sensitive
body/person.

The third phase of my life-to-date started a few years ago after my long lasting yoga
hobby turned into a lifestyle and professional calling. I realized that what my body needed relaxing and
winding down so that I could “hear” better. Through my yoga hobby and
yoga teacher training, I came to realize that being creative and
productive does not require existential anguish or anxiety. I can be
creative without stress if I stay true to my bodily sensations and
emotions, that are telling me important things about my environment. I
can create life even if I never become a mother. Understanding this meant
the critical examination and use of theoretical concepts, and embodied
experiential knowledge–finding my own rhythm of life. My holistic
science-and yoga-based life consultancy service combines scientific
knowledge of being a person-in-society with sensitive embodied
intuitive knowledge, ideology-free yoga and the joy of hip
hop. Finally, the Body and Mind can become One.
