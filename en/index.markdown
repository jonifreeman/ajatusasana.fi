__A new yoga concept: conceptual tools and bodily excercises–thoughts and asanas!__

What is the natural rhythm of my life? Would it be possible to live my life in sync
and in unison with other people’s rhythms? What about with the rhythms of the
ICT-based economy and working life? How could I get back in touch with
my creativity? How and when do I know that I am moving in the right
direction? How can I accomplish my true self, and at the same time be
a full-fledged member of society, working life, communities and family? 

My aim is to help you find the life instructor within you by giving you
tools for thought, and yoga asanas for exploring your sensing
body. Developing your internal compass can help you navigate the
social and material environment in a physically and mentally
beneficial way. The intention is an independent person, who feels good in
his/her body and in his/her immediate social surroundings. 

Once you start listening, you realize how wise the body can be. It whispers, it shouts, it laughs, it hums, it purrs of contentment. It converses. Ready to start a dialogue with your body? Come and to try one of my courses!
