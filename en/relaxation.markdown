**CONVERSATIONAL YOGA RELAXATION**

*For individuals in search of a new direction in their life*

*For couples in search of a more deeper and meaningful interconnection* 

Would you like to unwind in a relaxing atmosphere and be genuinely heard?  Are you searching for inspiration in some area of your (working) life or your relationship?  Or perhaps you just need a little nudge to better trust your intuition in decision-making? 

Conversational Yoga Relaxation is for anyone who would like to gain deeper awareness to a pressing issue in their (social)life. You do not need prior experience in relaxing or yoga. I combine different relaxation and somatic awareness techniques and holistic yoga with a deep socio-psychological understanding of the richness of human life.
