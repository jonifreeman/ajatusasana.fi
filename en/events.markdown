A lecture was given in English on Thursday 16th June 2016 at 7 pm at the new forthcoming Ajatus & Asana business premises (Kavallinm√§ki 15, Room 312, 02710 Espoo, right next to building where the current Ajatus & Asana Yoga Room is located). During the lecture a special demonstration of energy reading took place using some members of the audience. This second part of the session was not recorded due to privacy issues.

In the course of their visit Brian and his wife Francoise offered a unique Katsastus service to give an analytical reading of your aura. This is a detailed examination of your energy system, and any questions you have about relationships or work. Brian has conducted over 25,000 readings during his professional life over 40 years and will discover the most relevant points that you may need to bear in mind in your quest for self-improvement.
