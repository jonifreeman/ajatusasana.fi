Ajatus & Asana was born in April 2013.

I am here for You. 

My name is Stephanie Freeman. I am a yoga and body awareness teacher, Doctor of Philosophy (Behavioural Sciences) and M.A. (Educational sciences).I feel as though I am a bridge and translator between the world of science and that of yoga. I love  all things spiritual, yoga, meditation, animals, books, drums and my new hobby climbing (bouldering). My passion is learning. I have been a teacher of physical exercise in some form or another since 1989, and have always experienced things highly somatically. As I travel this life, I try to keep my eyes and hearth open, and see upcoming obstacles and contradictions as developmental challenges. After all, there is always the possibility of a new and refreshing start. Indeed. the body/mind is a miraculous minicosmos! When properly tuned, it can solve many a problem.

Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. I have encountered many losses within my 42-year trajectory, and tried to literally run away from life. Occasionally I have mistaken my head for my mind, hidden behind concpets and academic jargon. Scientific work and ambition, accompanied with (partly structural) competition, made my body and mind collapse a few times.  I made errors, overtaxed it’s capacity. However, yoga and other somatic approaches helped me tune dowm my “stress body”. I realized that what my body needed relaxing and winding down so that I could “hear” better. Through my daily yoga practice  and two-year yoga teacher training, I came to realize that being creative and productive does not require existential anguish or anxiety. I can be creative without stress if I stay true to my bodily sensations and emotions, that are telling me important things about my environment.  

Gradually, over a period of 14 years, my long lasting yoga hobby turned into a lifestyle and professional calling. As a teacher, my most powerful teacher is the interaction with students, or what I  prefer to call "fellow yoga travellers".
My holistic science-and yoga-based educationaly service combines scientific (psychological, sociological and fysiological-anatomical) knowledge of being a person-in-societywith sensitive embodied
intuitive knowledge and ideology-free yoga.
