My name is Stephanie Freeman and I would like to thank you for visiting my website.

For a long time now I have realised the transformative power of yoga.

The good news is that process of becoming creative and productive does not have to involve anguish or emotional anxiety.

I used to be a University researcher but over a period of 14 years I realised that my yoga lifestyle hobby was turning into a professional calling.

Gradually I became aware that the process of becoming creative and productive, of taking away the barriers of stress, can be a joy and pleasure.

We can be creative without stress if we learn to stay true to our body sensations and listen to what our emotions are telling us about our environment.

If we learn to relax and unwind we can better learn how to become more attuned our real selves.

When relaxed, we can also better understand our social situations and relationships, and free ourselves of possible contradictions.

Whe we are comfortable in our social interactions, we have more energy to create.

My company Ajatus and Asana was born in April 2013.

One of the exciting things about teaching is the interaction and learning experienced by the students and the teacher together. I see my students as â€œ fellow yoga travellers" who participate fully in the growth of themselves and their fellow students.

I also took a two-year course in training to become a yoga teacher in Helsinki.

You can expect to experience a 'science and yoga-based' educational service which combines
psychological, sociological and physiological knowledge but which is also fun and challenging.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any concerns or would simply like to know more
about what could be the investment of a lifetime.

**My motto: Thoughts can be your friends. Asanas help you in the process.**
